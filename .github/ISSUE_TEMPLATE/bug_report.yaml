        > Do NOT open an issue if you're getting an error saying "`The given key 'redist.zip' was not present in the dictionary.`", or if you're getting stuck on "Configuring Roblox...".
        > This problem has been fixed in the latest version of Bloxstrap. You either have auto-updates disabled or are using someone's custom build of an old version.
        > Download the latest version [here](https://github.com/pikminmario500/bloxstrap/releases/latest).
        ### **Preliminary instructions**
        - Before opening an issue, please [check the Wiki first](https://github.com/bloxstraplabs/bloxstrap/wiki/) to see if your problem has been addressed there.
          - If it isn't, please confirm which pages that you read that were relevant to your issue.
          - Your issue ***will*** be closed without warning if there's a Wiki page addressing your problem.
        - If your problem is with Roblox itself (i.e. it crashes or doesn't launch), [check to see if it happens without Bloxstrap](https://github.com/bloxstraplabs/bloxstrap/wiki/Roblox-crashes-or-does-not-launch). 
          - Please only open an issue if your problem happens only with Bloxstrap, and state clearly that this is the case, as anything else is out of my control.
        - If you are getting a Bloxstrap Exception error, please attach a copy of the provided log file. There is a button on the dialog that locates it for you.
        - Also, please ensure you are using the [latest version of Bloxstrap](https://github.com/pikminmario500/bloxstrap/releases/latest). Your report will be null and void if you are not.
        - If more clarification on the issue is needed, and you don't respond after a month, then your issue will be closed as stale.
